  <span class="line">Get out of bed, you silly fool!</span>
  <span class="line">Get up right now, it's time for school.</span>
  <span class="line">If you don't dress without a fuss,</span>
  <span class="line">I'll throw you naked on the bus!</span>

  <span class="line">Oh, Mom, don't make me go today.</span>
  <span class="line">I'm feeling worse than yesterday.</span>
  <span class="line">You don't know what I'm going through.</span>
  <span class="line">I've got a strange, rare case of flu.</span>

  <span class="line">You faked a headache yesterday.</span>
  <span class="line">Don't pull that stuff on me today.</span>

  <span class="line">Stop acting like a silly fool-</span>
  <span class="line">The principal cannot skip school!</span>
