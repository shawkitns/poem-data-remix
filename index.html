      This project is an iterative exploration of typography through HTML and CSS.
      The aim is to have a variety of 20 visual treatments that respond to the poem’s content.
      The text is an excerpt from <em>Get Out of Bed</em> by Diane Shore, which you can read below:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Get out of bed, you silly fool!<br>
      Get up right now, it's time for school.<br>
      If you don't dress without a fuss,<br>
      I'll throw you naked on the bus!”
      <br><br>
      “Oh, Mom, don't make me go today.<br>
      I'm feeling worse than yesterday.<br>
      You don't know what I'm going through.<br>
      I've got a strange, rare case of flu.”
      <br><br>
      “You faked a headache yesterday.<br>
      Don't pull that stuff on me today.<br>
      Stop acting like a silly fool—<br>
      The principal cannot skip school!”
    </blockquote>

      Each visual style category obeys a rule. In addition to the five rules, the
      last visual link is a reference to a pop culture movie keeping in theme with
      daydreaming, play time, study, skipping classes, and all things school.
